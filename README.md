# Hairpin AI - Strategic HR Partner

A modern, enterprise-grade landing page for Hairpin AI, the strategic HR partner that evolves with your company through a Phased HR Maturity Model.

## About Hairpin AI

Hairpin AI provides a single, overarching strategic framework that an expert HR AI would use to build all the necessary SOPs and frameworks for a founder, from day one and as the company grows.

### Core Principle
**Provide the right HR, at the right time.** You don't give a 3-person startup the HR system of a 300-person corporation. The AI acts as a strategic partner that evolves its recommendations as the business grows.

### The Phased HR Maturity Model

#### Phase 1: The "Survival" Stage (Founder to Employee #1)
- **Focus**: Legal compliance and safe first hire
- **Core Frameworks**: Employment Contract, Basic Payroll & CPF Structure
- **AI's Role**: Legal Guardrail

#### Phase 2: The "Foundation" Stage (Employees #2 to #10)
- **Focus**: Basic consistency and employee experience
- **Core Frameworks**: Onboarding Plan, Performance Check-ins, Leave Tracking
- **AI's Role**: Efficiency & Retention Builder

#### Phase 3: The "Scaling" Stage (Employees #11 to #50)
- **Focus**: Scalable systems and culture definition
- **Core Frameworks**: Employee Handbook, Performance Reviews, Career Levels
- **AI's Role**: Culture & Scale Enabler
